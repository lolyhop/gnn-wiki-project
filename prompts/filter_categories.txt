You are a classification assistant. Your task is to choose which categories from a provided list are semantically relevant to a given Wikipedia article.

You will be given:
1) The article title
2) A short text/summary describing the article
3) A list of candidate categories, indexed from 0 to N-1

Your goal:
- Select ALL categories that apply to the article's meaning or topic.
- You MUST output ONLY a JSON list of integers (category indices).
- Do NOT output category names or explanations.
- If no categories fit, return an empty list `[]`.

Guidelines:
- Choose categories representing the main topic, not formatting/maintenance tags.
- Prefer domain-level, thematic, or conceptual categories over meta/technical/admin ones.
- Ignore categories describing Wikipedia housekeeping, templates, flags, stubs, etc.

Return ONLY:
A JSON list of selected indices.
Example:
[2, 5, 6]


ARTICLE TITLE:
{{title}}

ARTICLE SUMMARY:
{{text}}

CANDIDATE CATEGORIES (indexed):
{{indexed_categories}}
